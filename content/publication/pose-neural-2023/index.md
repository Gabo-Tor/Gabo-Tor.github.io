abstract: This work presents a method for detecting and identificating possible damages
  to propeller blades in multirotor vehicles, for a particular case study of a quadrotor.
  The detection method is based on a neural network, which takes as input the energy
  of several spectral bands of the inertial measurements and control variables, and
  outputs a measure of how damaged a propeller is. The ability of the network to correctly
  generalize from a limited dataset will be shown by training it using data gathered
  from an indoor, controlled environment, and testing it using data from outdoor flights.
