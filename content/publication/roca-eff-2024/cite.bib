  abstract={This paper examines the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning for detecting endangered deer species in their natural habitats. As traditional identification processes require trained manual labor that can be costly in resources and time, there is a need for more efficient solutions. Leveraging high-resolution aerial imagery, advanced computer vision techniques are applied to automate the identification process of deer across two distinct projects in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first project, Pantano Project, involves the marsh deer in the Paraná Delta, while the second, WiMoBo, focuses on the Pampas deer in Campos del Tuyú National Park. A tailored algorithm was developed using the YOLO framework, trained on extensive datasets compiled from UAV-captured images. The findings demonstrate that the algorithm effectively identifies marsh deer with a high degree of accuracy and provides initial insights into its applicability to Pampas deer, albeit with noted limitations. This study not only supports ongoing conservation efforts but also highlights the potential of integrating AI with UAV technology to enhance wildlife monitoring and management practices.},
