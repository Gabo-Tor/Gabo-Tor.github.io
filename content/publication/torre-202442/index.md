abstract: In this work, we will consider a reinforced learning controller developed
  for a quadrupedal robot and we learn for which cost function such a controller is
  an optimal control. In particular, we will transform the learning problem into a
  quadratic programming problem and solve it to obtain the learned cost function.
  Our approach is based on second-order Lagrangian mechanics since we will use that
  an optimal control problem is equivalent to a second-order variational problem.
  We also obtain error bounds for the approximation of the cost function.
