abstract: In this paper Balancio-Kit is presented, a low-cost self balancing robot,
  targeted to robotics, systems control, and machine learning students and enthusiasts,
  at different knowledge levels. The platform comes with various additions, such as
  CAD files; a Bluetooth application to command the robot; a simulation, where the
  user can evaluate different control algorithms or train reinforcement learning agents;
  and a tested workflow to implement neural networks inside a low-cost microprocessor.
  It is designed to be low-cost and easy to assemble, simple to flash software and
  to be upgradable and remixable. Implemented using well-known software like Arduino
  IDE and open source tools like Pybullet and Open AI Gym.
